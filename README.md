# Sales-Insights-of-AtliQ-Hardwares
Generated an automated report ( Sales Insights ) for an organization named AtliQ Hardware using Power BI and SQL for creating an insightful dashboard.
# Problem statement: 
AtliQ Hardware is a company specializing in computer hardware and peripheral manufacturing, serving clients across India through its numerous branches. The sales director is grappling with challenges in gauging the company's performance and identifying existing issues, given the unexpected and gradual decline in sales. When reaching out to regional managers for updates on sales and market conditions, the director encounters a common human tendency: reluctance to engage with numerical data presented in Excel files, leading to frustration.
# Solution : 
The Sales Director at AltiQ Hardware made a strategic decision to enhance data comprehension and decision-making by implementing a PowerBI Dashboard. To execute this plan, they assembled a team of skilled data professionals tasked with transforming raw data into visually intuitive representations. This initiative aims to empower the company with actionable insights derived from comprehensive data analysis, facilitating informed business strategies and driving improved sales performance.
